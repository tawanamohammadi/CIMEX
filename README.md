- **GOST Forwarding**: Forward traffic from Iran nodes to Foreign servers with support for TCP, UDP, WebSocket, gRPC, and TCPMux

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- For Iran servers, install Docker first:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manageitir/docker/main/install-ubuntu.sh | sh
  ```

---

## 🖥️ Node Installation

### Architecture

- **Iran Nodes**: Handle reverse tunnels (Rathole, Backhaul, Chisel, FRP) and run GOST forwarders
- **Foreign Nodes**: Participate in reverse tunnels and receive forwarded traffic from Iran nodes

### Quick Install

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tawanamohammadi/CIMEX/main/scripts/cimex-node.sh)"
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual Install</strong></summary>

1. Navigate to node directory:
```bash
cd node
```

2. Copy Panel CA certificate:
```bash
mkdir -p certs
# For Iran nodes, use ca.crt
cp /path/to/panel/ca.crt certs/ca.crt
# For Foreign servers, use ca-server.crt
# cp /path/to/panel/ca-server.crt certs/ca.crt
```

3. Create `.env` file:
```bash
cat > .env << EOF
NODE_API_PORT=8888
NODE_NAME=node-1
PANEL_CA_PATH=/etc/cimex-node/certs/ca.crt
PANEL_ADDRESS=panel.example.com:443
EOF
```

> **Note**: The panel validates node roles during registration. Each node must have a consistent role (iran or foreign) to prevent conflicts.

4. Start node:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## 🛠️ CLI Tools

### Panel CLI (`cimex`)

**Admin Management:**
```bash
cimex admin create      # Create admin user
cimex admin update      # Update admin password
```

**Panel Management:**
```bash
cimex status            # Show system status
cimex update            # Update panel (pull images and recreate)
cimex restart           # Restart panel (recreate to pick up .env changes)
cimex logs              # View panel logs
```

**Configuration:**
```bash
cimex edit              # Edit docker-compose.yml
cimex edit-env          # Edit .env file
```

### Node CLI (`cimex-node`)

**Node Management:**
```bash
cimex-node status       # Show node status
cimex-node update       # Update node (pull images and recreate)
cimex-node restart      # Restart node (recreate to pick up .env changes)
cimex-node logs         # View node logs

## 📖 Tunnel Types

### GOST Tunnels (Iran Node Forwarding)
- **TCP**: Simple TCP forwarding
- **UDP**: UDP packet forwarding
- **WebSocket (WS)**: WebSocket protocol forwarding
- **gRPC**: gRPC protocol forwarding
- **TCPMux**: TCP multiplexing for multiple connections

GOST tunnels run on Iran nodes and forward traffic to Foreign servers. When creating a GOST tunnel, specify both an Iran node and a Foreign server. The Iran node will listen on the specified port and forward all traffic to the Foreign server's IP address and port.

### Backhaul Tunnels (Reverse Tunnel)
- **TCP / UDP**: Low-latency reverse tunnels with optional UDP-over-TCP
- **WS / WSMux**: WebSocket transports for CDN-friendly deployments
- **TCPMux**: TCP multiplexing support
- **Advanced Controls**: Configure multiplexing, keepalive, sniffer, and custom port maps per tunnel

The panel automatically configures both Iran and Foreign nodes when creating a tunnel.

### Rathole Tunnels (Reverse Tunnel)
- **TCP**: Standard TCP reverse tunnel
- **WebSocket (WS)**: WebSocket transport support

Rathole tunnels allow you to expose services running on the Foreign node's network through the Iran node.

### Chisel Tunnels (Reverse Tunnel)
Chisel tunnels provide fast TCP reverse tunnel functionality, enabling you to expose services running on the Foreign node's network through the Iran node with high performance.

### FRP Tunnels (Reverse Tunnel)
FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy) tunnels provide reliable TCP/UDP reverse tunnel functionality. FRP supports both TCP and UDP protocols, with optional IPv6 support for tunneling IPv6 traffic over IPv4 networks.
